      <h4 class="location-subtitle">The ‘Quin House is a gathering place that reflects the new Boston—a city that continues to transform itself into a wellspring of technological, artistic, and cultural innovation. Nestled in the heart of Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood at 217 Commonwealth Avenue, this diverse social club will bring together the region’s leaders, creators, innovators, and rising stars to forge meaningful connections. The clubhouse  was originally The Algonquin Club, established in 1886.  It remains the only building in Boston specifically designed as a social club.  The ‘Quin House's interior has been re-imagined by renowned Creative Director and Designer, Ken Fulk as a vibrant playground for the mind, body and spirit. Designed to stimulate the senses from eye-catching decor to the delicious culinary experiences and exciting programming. The result is a chic, comfortable and inviting home away from home.</h4>
